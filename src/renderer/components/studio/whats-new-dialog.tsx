/**
 * "Vey Studio is now 1.0.19", once, on the first launch after an update — with
 * the notes of every release since the one last seen.
 *
 * The one thing the updater pops up, and only after the fact: the update was
 * asked for, through the pill, so saying what it brought is the end of that
 * gesture rather than an interruption of something else. A release *being
 * available* still never opens anything (`lib/updates.ts`).
 *
 * `ready` is `Studio` saying the launch screen, the setup screen and the tour
 * are all out of the way. Recorded as seen the moment it opens, not when it is
 * closed: a quit with the dialog up has still shown it. A failed fetch records
 * nothing, so an update installed offline is announced on the next launch that
 * can reach GitHub — with that release's notes and any after it.
