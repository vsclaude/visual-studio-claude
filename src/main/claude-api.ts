/**
 * A **custom API** profile: a `claude` pointed at an Anthropic-compatible
 * endpoint other than Anthropic's own sign-in — a GLM, Kimi or DeepSeek
 * coding plan, OpenRouter, a company's gateway. Free, like every account —
 * it was Vey Pro's for a day (`docs/design.md` § Pro).
 *
 * Nothing is logged in. The profile is its `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` like any other
 * — its own history and settings — plus the variables the CLI already reads
 * for this: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, the key as `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (a
 * `Bearer` header, which is what these endpoints document), and the model
 * names the CLI's aliases resolve to, since `sonnet` means nothing to a
 * server that serves `glm-4.6`.
 *
 * **The key is never in the profile list.** The list is the renderer's and is
 * written whole to `claude-profiles.json`; the key is sealed by the OS
 * keychain (`Host.seal`) and kept in the settings under `apiTokenKey(id)`,
 * read only here. A profile reaches a turn through `accountEnv`, which asks
 * `apiEnvFor` with nothing but the directory — the one thing every caller
 * (a chat's session, a rewind, the commit draft, the model list, the usage
 * meter) already has — so the endpoints are held here, by directory, and
 * re-read by `ipc.ts` whenever the list is.
 *
 * Free of `electron`: `apiEnv` is what `test/claude-api.ts` checks.
