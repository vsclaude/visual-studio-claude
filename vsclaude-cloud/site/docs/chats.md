# Chats

A chat is one Claude Code conversation, running in one project's folder. You
can have as many open as you like, in as many projects as you like, and they
all keep working while you read something else.

![A chat: the projects column with its chats on the left, the conversation in the middle, and the composer at the bottom](/screenshots/chat.png)

## Starting a chat

Press **+** on a project's row, or right-click the project and choose **New
chat here**. The tab opens at once; the chat is saved when you send its first
message, so a tab you never typed in leaves nothing behind.

A chat is named after the first thing you ask, then renamed with Claude Code's
own title once it has one. Right-click the chat and choose **Rename** to give
it your own — a name you chose is never replaced.

## The composer

Everything about how the next message runs is in the bar under the text box:

- **Account** — which Claude account the chat runs on, or **Pay with
  credits**. See [Claude accounts](/docs/accounts).
- **Model** and **effort** — Haiku, Sonnet or Opus, and how hard it thinks
  (Low to Max). Both can be changed between messages without restarting the
  chat.
- **Permission** — what the chat may do on its own (below).
- **Context left** — how much room the conversation has before it is
  compacted, and the account's five-hour meter.

**Inherit** uses whatever your own `claude` is set to. Star a model to keep it
near the top.

The **+** at the right of the composer holds the rest: **Attach file** (`⌘U`),
**Mention a file…** (`@`), **Run a command…** (`/`, Claude Code's slash
commands) and **MCP servers…**.

![The composer's + menu: Attach file, Mention a file, Run a command, MCP servers](/screenshots/chat-add-menu.png)

Press `Enter` to send and `Shift+Enter` for a new line.

### Permission modes

| Mode            | What it does                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Plan**        | Reads, and answers with a plan. Changes nothing.                   |
| **Read only**   | Reads and answers. No edits, no shell.                             |
| **Ask**         | Asks exactly what the `claude` CLI would, under your own settings. |
| **Edits**       | Edits files and runs commands in this folder. The default.         |
| **Full access** | Nothing is asked, including tools VS Claude has not listed.        |

![The permission menu: Plan, Read only, Ask, Edits and Full access](/screenshots/chat-permissions.png)

When a chat needs your permission, a card appears above the composer with the
call it wants to make. The chat waits — for as long as it takes — until you
allow or refuse it. Changing mode mid-chat is cheap: it does not throw away
the conversation's cache.

### Mentioning files

Type `@` to pick a file or folder of the project. The mention is just the path,
so Claude opens the file as it is now rather than a copy.

![Typing @ lists the project's folders and files, each with roughly how many tokens it is](/screenshots/chat-mention.png)

### Pictures

Paste a screenshot or drop an image into the composer. It is attached as
`[Image #1]`, and shows as a thumbnail both in the composer and in the
conversation.

### Selecting text to reply

Select part of a reply and a **Reply** button appears beside it: it quotes the
selection into the composer so you can ask about exactly that.

## While a chat is working

- **Keep typing.** A message sent while Claude is still working is queued
  behind the current turn and marked **Queued** until it is picked up.
- **Stop** interrupts the turn without closing the chat.
- Background subagents are listed in the chat while they run.

## Editing a message

Hover one of your own messages and choose **Edit**. The conversation is cut
back to just before it, **and the files Claude changed after it are put back**
too, then your edited message is sent. Use it to take a different path without
starting over.

## Finding things in a chat

- `⌘F` opens a find bar over the conversation, including inside folded tool
  output.
- The outline beside the conversation lists every message you sent; click one
  to jump to it.

## MCP servers

The chat uses the MCP servers your own `claude` already has for that folder —
`~/.claude.json`, the project's `.mcp.json`, plugins and claude.ai connectors.
Open **MCP servers…** from the composer's **+** menu to see them, and switch off any
tool or whole server for this chat alone. Changing that list starts a fresh
session behind the scenes; the conversation carries on.

## Knowing when a chat needs you

You do not have to watch a chat to know where it is:

- A **spinner** on the chat's row while it works, and a **shield** when it is
  stopped on a question. A collapsed project shows a count.
- A **dot and a bold title** on a chat that answered while you were reading
  another one — it is _unread_.
- A **notification** when a chat finishes, fails or asks something while the
  window is in the background (switch it off in **Settings › Chats**).
- A **red badge** on the app's dock icon counting unread chats and chats
  waiting on you.

## A chat in its own window

The **Open in its own window** button at the top of a chat pops it out — handy
on a second screen. A popped-out chat can be pinned on top of other windows.

## Exporting, deleting

Right-click a chat for **Copy as Markdown**, **Export as Markdown…** and
**Export as HTML…**, or **Delete chat…**. Deleting a chat removes the
conversation from VS Claude, with no undo; it does not touch your files.

## Limits and long chats

When an account reaches its limit, switch the chat to another account or to
credits from the **Account** menu — nothing said so far is lost. The meter
beside the composer shows how much of the account's five-hour window is used.
Very long conversations are compacted automatically by Claude Code.
