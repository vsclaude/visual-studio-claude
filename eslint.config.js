/**
 * One config for the whole app, scoped by directory.
 *
 * The main process and the renderer do not share globals — `process` is not in
 * a page and `document` is not in the main process — so the two halves get
 * their own `languageOptions` rather than a union that would typecheck code
 * neither side can run.
 *
 * `only-warn` turns every rule into a warning, and `lint` runs with
 * `--max-warnings 0`, so nothing is silently tolerated while the output still
 * reads as a list of things to fix rather than a wall of errors.
