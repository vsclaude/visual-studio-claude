# Terminal and search

## Terminal

The terminal sits under the chat or file you are reading, across its whole
width. Each shell is a tab; **+** opens another, in the current project's
folder.

| Keys      | Does                      |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| `` ⌃` ``  | Show or hide the terminal |
| `` ⌃⇧` `` | A new terminal            |

`` ⌃` `` works from inside the shell too, so you can hide the terminal right
after running something in it.

- `⌘`-click a file path in the output to open the file.
- Select some output and send it to the current chat's composer, to ask about
  an error without copying it by hand.
- **Restart shell** starts a fresh one in the same tab.

Shells end when Vey Studio quits.

## Search

**Search** (`⇧⌘F`, or the magnifier on the left rail) looks through every file
in every project **and** everything said in every chat.

- `Aa` matches case, `ab` whole words, `.*` a regular expression.
- Narrow it with **All** / **Files** / **Chats**, **Search only this project**,
  and the files to include and to exclude (`src/**`, `*.test.ts`).
- **Replace** rewrites matches in files, one match or one file at a time.
  Chats are never changed. With `.*` on, `$1` in the replacement is the first
  group, `$&` the whole match.
- `F4` / `⇧F4` walk the results; `⌫` dismisses one.

Click a result to open the file at that line, or the chat at that message.

## The command palette

`⌘P`, or the **Run a command** field in the title bar, finds a file or a chat
by name.
