 * What the machine has left, along the bottom of the window.

 * database, a query returning more rows than expected — and the question this
 * answers is the one asked *while* that is happening: is the machine the thing
 * that is slow, and is it this app doing it. Which is why the app's own share
 * sits in the same row, on the same scale, rather than being a thing to go
 * and look up in Activity Monitor: the comparison is the whole point.
 *
 * At the bottom of the workbench rather than in the header, and never in the
 * way: this is a number to glance at, not one to act on, and the header is
 * already where the things you click live.
 *
 * Ahead of the meters, the two things that change while somebody is reading
 * something else: where the checkout stands (`GitLabel`) and what the chats are
 * doing (`ChatsLabel`). Both are a click away from the panel that says more.
