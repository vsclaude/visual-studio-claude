 * A hook rather than a store because there is nothing to keep: the list is
 * whatever the CLI said, it does not change while the app is running, and
 * nothing writes to it. Main holds the answer for the run (`agent-models.ts`)
 * and this holds it for the window, so the second composer to mount gets it
 * without a round trip and the picker has its labels before it is opened —
 * which is the reason this runs on mount rather than on the menu opening: the
 * toolbar button draws the *name* of the chosen model, and a button that says
 * `opus` until somebody clicks it is a button that was waiting for nothing.
 *
 * The fallback stands in whenever the ask came back with nothing — a `claude`
 * that is not installed yet, or a spawn that timed out — because a picker with
 * no rows is a chat nobody can change the model of. It is deliberately three
 * aliases and not a guess at this machine's list; see `CHAT_MODEL_FALLBACK`.
