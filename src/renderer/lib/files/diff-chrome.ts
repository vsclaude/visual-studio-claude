/**
 * The unified diff, drawn the way a pull request is.
 *
 * `@codemirror/merge` gives the diff itself — the chunks, the collapsed
 * unchanged regions, the removed lines as widgets between the kept ones — and
 * draws it as one editor with a thin coloured gutter. What a reader recognises
 * as a diff is more specific: **an old line number, a new line number, a `+`/`-`
 * column, the row tinted from the sign across, and a `@@` bar where the file was
 * skipped.** That is what this file adds, on top of the merge extension rather
 * than in place of it.
 *
 * The colours and the metrics are Primer's, because half of reading a diff is
 * knowing at a glance which side you are on, and that association is already
 * built for anyone who reviews code.
 *
 * Two things about the *structure* are worth knowing before changing any of it,
 * because both were got wrong first:
 *
 * - **A removed line is not a line of this document.** The merge extension
 *   renders a whole removed chunk as one block widget inside `.cm-content`, and
 *   builds its inner rows itself. Drawing that row's own number with a
 *   `::before` on it does not work: the content column already starts *after*
 *   the gutters, so the number lands a gutter's width too far right (and pulling
 *   it back with a negative margin puts it under the sticky gutters, where it is
 *   invisible). The numbers come from `widgetMarker` instead — a gutter is asked
 *   what to draw beside a widget, and a marker holding one row per removed line
 *   at the same line height lines up because the widget's height *is* those rows.
 * - **The row tint cannot come from the merge extension's gutter classes.** Its
 *   `cm-changedLineGutter` only exists when its own `gutter` option is on, and it
 *   is off here — the `+`/`-` column says the same thing in the form a diff is
 *   read in. So the tint travels on `GutterMarker.elementClass`, which is the
 *   API for exactly this.
 */

/** How many unchanged lines of context a hunk keeps around its changes, and the
 * shortest run worth folding. Both are `@codemirror/merge`'s own defaults, kept
