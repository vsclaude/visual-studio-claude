# Projects and files

## Projects

A project is a folder already on your machine. VS Claude works on it where it
is — it never copies, moves or uploads it. Add as many as you like; they are
all listed in the **Projects** column on the left, each with its chats under
it.

- **Add a folder** — click **+** beside **Projects**, pick a folder or drag one
  in, and click **Add folder**.
- **From template** — the same dialog's second tab starts a new project:
  Next.js, Nuxt, Vite + React, Vite + Vue, Vite + Svelte or plain Vite. VS
  Claude makes the folder and runs the framework's own `create-*` tool in a
  terminal, so you get exactly what that tool makes today.

Right-click a project for **New chat here**, **New terminal here**,
**Rename…**, **Copy path**, **Reveal in file manager**, **Change icon…** and
**Remove project**. Removing a project only takes it out of the list; the
folder stays on disk. A project started from a template can also be sent to the
trash with **Move to Trash…**.

A project shows its 20 most recent chats; **View all** lists the rest. `⌘B`
hides or shows the column.

## Tabs

Chats, files and diffs open as tabs along the top. By default the strip only
shows the tabs of the project you are working in; turn on **Settings › Tabs &
editor › Show tabs from every project** to see them all.

| Keys          | Does                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `⌘1` … `⌘9`   | The n-th tab (`⌘9`, the last) |
| `⌘⇧[` / `⌘⇧]` | The tab to the left / right   |
| `Ctrl+Tab`    | The next tab                  |
| `⌘W`          | Close the tab                 |

## Explorer

The panel on the right has two tabs: **All files** and **Git** (see
[Git](/docs/git)). It folds down to a narrow rail when you need the room.

In **All files**, files are coloured by their git status, and a changed file
is marked `M`. Right-click a file to open it as text or as its diff (**Open
with**), **Copy** or **Cut** it, **Copy path** or **Copy relative path**,
**Reveal in file manager**, **Rename** it or **Move to trash…** — VS Claude
never erases a file outright. A folder also offers **New file** and **New
folder**.

## The editor

Click a file to open it in a tab. The editor highlights some 140 languages,
and `⌘S` saves.

- **Markdown** files can be opened in a block editor, with a live preview of
  headings, lists, tables, pictures and drawings.
- **HTML** files have a preview.
- **Merge conflicts** are marked in the file, with **Accept Current Change**,
  **Accept Incoming Change** and **Accept Both Changes** above each one.
- **Who last changed a line** — with **Settings › Tabs & editor › Show who last
  changed the line** on, the current line ends with its author and commit,
  like GitLens. Click it for every commit that ever touched that line.

## Pictures

Images open in a viewer with an editor behind **Edit image**: crop, resize,
rotate, flip, and draw on it with a pen, rectangles and arrows. **Save image**
writes it back in its own format.
