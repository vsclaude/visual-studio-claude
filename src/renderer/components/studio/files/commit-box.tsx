/**
 * The message, and the button that ends a reading of the diff.
 *
 * **This app did not commit, deliberately, and this is the reversal.** The rule
 * was that staging and discarding are answered by pointing at rows while a
 * commit is a *sentence somebody writes* — and a panel this narrow is a bad
 * place to write a paragraph, with a shell one click away in the dock that is a
 * better one. What changed is the sentence: the read-only `claude` this app
 * already runs can draft it off the staged diff (`draftCommitMessage`), so the
 * gesture is now reading a diff and then ending that reading, which is the one
 * thing every other panel here lets somebody do to what it is showing.
 *
 * The line moved by exactly one step and no further. There is no amend, no log,
 * no branch and no push, and there will not be: those are a git client, and the
 * shell in the dock is a better one than this would ever become.
 * `docs/design.md` § Committing carries the argument in full.
 *
 * Drawn only when something is **staged**, which is also what makes it honest
 * about what it commits. A box that was always there would be a box that
 * commits nothing most of the time, and one that committed the working tree
 * would be a second meaning for `Staged` two rows below it.
